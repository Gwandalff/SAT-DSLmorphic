#Part 1 
There is some well-formed rules we should check for the well use of the grammar. 
	- name of the atom should be unique and not confusing with the names of the operator 

#Part 2 
	We guess that the general structure of the metamodel are similar. But there is some small differences : 
	- operators are not sub-classes but attribut of the class ExprUn and ExprBin 
	- ExprBin has a left and right argument
	- Var can be a string with a value or an atom with a name. In the firt milestone it was a variable with a name and a value.
